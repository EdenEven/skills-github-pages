# Embarking on My Web Development Journey

*Posted on December 24, 2024*

Starting my web development journey has been both challenging and exciting. Today marks my first project: building an AI-powered market research platform called Entrakit LLC.

The project involves creating interactive components with React, styling with Tailwind CSS, and implementing real-time data visualization. While the initial deployment to Vercel presented some hurdles, each obstacle teaches valuable lessons about web development in practice.

Key learnings so far:
- The importance of proper project documentation
- How to structure React components effectively
- The power of modular CSS with Tailwind
- Real-world application of Git and version control

Looking forward to sharing more insights as I progress through this course. Next up: implementing user authentication and API integration.
